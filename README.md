<Forself: Referring to a model means getting access to all the data from that model. Thus, when that collection is dropped. We need to check like: if (details.sentTo && details.sentTo.name) also the details.sentTo.name or sentBy.name is unnecessary as checking whether the id exists in the database is enough)
